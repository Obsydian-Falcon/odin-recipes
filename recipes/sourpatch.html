    <!-- Paragraphs -->
    <p>So, gummies. Some say the most sacred of edibles. I say that they're just
        the easiest to make. Melt down some gelatin, add cannabis, then let
        it cool down. This recipe is simple to follow and simpler to execute.

    <h2>Cooking Instructions</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Place the non-stick pan onto a low-medium heat</li>
        <li>Add water and cannabis coconut oil to the pan and stir lightly</li>
        <li>Add 2 tablespoons of lemon juice</li>    
        <li>Now, add gelatin, stirring out any lumps that may form</li>
        <li>In the meantime, line moulds with a small amount of granulated sugar, 
            ensuring an even coating across the entire bottom of the mould</li>    
        <li>Once the heating mixture has no lumps of gelatin, add the jello</li>
        <li>Stir thoroughly and mix all of the ingredients together using a ‘whipping’ technique</li>
        <li>Once the ingredients have combined and oxygen bubbles begin to appear in the mixture, 
            quickly transfer from the pan to the measuring jug</li>
        <li>Once this has been done, pour the canna gummy mixture into the moulds and chill/freeze until solid</li>
        <li>Remove from the freezer/fridge and moulds. Top with a small amount of granulated sugar if desired.</li>    
        <li>After around 2 hours in the freezer, your sour patch-style cannabis gummies are ready to eat</li>
    </ol>
